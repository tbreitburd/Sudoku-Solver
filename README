# C1 Coursework - Sudoku Solver

## Description
This reporsitory contains the code and written report for the C1 Coursework. The aim was to demonstrate software developping good practice applied to the development of a sudoku solver.

## Contents

Inside this ```tmb76/``` directory, there are a few sub-directories one can explore. The s the code directory (```src/```), which contains all the code used in the solver. The second is the sudokus directory (```sudokus/```), which contains a few sudokus one can use if they don't have sudokus ready. An important note is that the solver will give the solutions in the command line but also store them in a ```sudoku_solutions/``` directory which will be created as the first sudoku is solved. So if there is no ```sudoku_solutions/``` directory in the repository yet, running the solver once should lead to creating one. Then comes the ```profiling/``` directory, which simply enables one to do some profiling on the solver if one were inclined to further improve this solver. It is by no means, the best of the many that exists. The last one is the ```report/``` directory, which contains the LaTeX file for the report, as well as the pdf version of it, along with the references ```.bib``` file.
More importantly, there are an ```environment.yml``` file and a ```Dockerfile```, which uses it, which one is advised to use.

## How to run the code
For permissions reasons, the ```Dockerfile``` is not set up to pull the repository directly as it builds the image. Therefore, one must first download this repository to their local machine and then are free to build the Docker image from the ```Dockerfile```.

To run the solver on a Docker container, one first has to build the image and run the container. This can be done as follows:

```bash
$ docker build -t c1_coursework
$ docker run --rm -ti c1_coursework
```

The ```c1_coursework``` is not a strict instruction, it can be set to any other name the user may prefer.

If there is a need to get the sudoku solutions back on the local machine, the second line above can be ran without the ```--rm``` and also set the container name using ```--name=container_name``` (any valid name is fine). From there, run all the code as instructed below. Once all desired sudokus have been solved. One can exit the container and then run:

```bash
$ docker cp docker cp container_name:/C1_Coursework/sudoku_solutions ./sudoku_solutions
```

The ```sudoku_solutions/``` directory will get copied into the local folder the container was ran from.

As you run this, the Docker image will get built and the container ran, providing the user with a bash terminal-like interface where the solver code can be run as follows:

```bash
$ python -m src.solve_sudoku path/to/sudoku.txt 'bactracking_type' backtracking_only
```

The ```-m``` flag is used to run the file as a module, which is to deal with the relative imports in the code. The path/to/sudoku.txt is the path to the sudoku file, in the format below.
The ```'backtracking_type'``` argument can either
be ’forward’, ’backward’, or ’ordered’, this sets the order in which the backtracking algorithm iterates through the sudoku.
The ```backtracking_only``` argument must be a Bool value, and is used to set the solver to only use backtracking (True) or also use the candidate checking method (False). The solver will print the solved sudoku to the command line, and also write a .txt file with the same name as the input sudoku file, in a ```sudoku_solution/``` directory, which will get created if it doesn’t exist yet.
For the ```perf_timer.py``` and ```profiling.py``` files, the user can run them from the command line using the following commands:

```bash
$ python -m profiling.perf_timer backtracking_only
$ python -m profiling.profiling path/to/sudoku.txt ’backtracking_type’ backtracking_only
```

The ```profiling.py``` is currently set to profiling the entire solving, but one can decide to profile specific functions of the solver, once they get to grips with how the solver works. The profiling will be printed to the command line but for easier reading, it is also printed to a

The ```perf_timer.py``` file makes use of a ```sudokus.csv``` which is not saved in this repository, but can be easily obtained on this Kaggle page [1]. One can decide to only take a subset of the available sudokus. For the timing results in the report around 2000 sudokus were used.


Note on time: Most sudokus should get solved in the order of seconds, though some, like the ```anti_backtracking.txt``` sudoku, can take much longer in the "standard" ```'forward'``` backtracking order. If this happens, the user is encouraged to try the other backtracking orders. The ```perf_timer.py``` can also take a good amount of time, mostly depending on the size of the ```sudokus.csv``` provided. Though, for 2000 sudokus, it took around a few minutes to run. This is based on running all of these on a MacBook Air M2 (2022, Ventura 13.2.1), with 8 GB of Memory, so this may be slower on a container.


## Further development

If one wishes to further develop this code, when the image is built, git is installed and initialized and the pre-commit hooks are installed.

## Use of Generative AI

GitHub Copilot's autocompletion feature was used in coding the project, when writing docstrings for the functions, though sometimes adding elements ourselves, and for repetitive parts of the code.
ChatGPT was also used to help in debugging the code, by providing the traceback as a prompt when an error was difficult to understand, asking to explain what the error refers to.
